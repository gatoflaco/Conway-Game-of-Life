# Conway-Game-of-Life
Based on a popular beginner's problem.
The purpose of this repository is for testing some debugging tools for C (or C++) code.
Specifically, I have set up a template for running the Visual Studio Code debugger on a sample C program.
The setup files are contained in the .vscode directory. They rely on the provided makefile.
